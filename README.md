# RacketPal
This is the Internship React Native Task assingment of Mihai Balan
IDE: Visual Studio Code;
Dependencies: React Native, Node.JS, React Native Navigator (NavigationContainer);
Debugging was done in Expo Client, Web Browserâ€™s Dev Tools and Terminal;
What I have done:
  This project is a React Native Application that allows the user to introduce a github username and returns the list of repositories the user owns or contributes.
  I used the Github Api in order to get the username and  repos. Also I used React navigation and stack in order to navigate through the screens.
  I took into consideration two possibilities that could lead to unexpected errors: if the username does not exist, we return the list as null. The button is aswell disabled if       there is no text inserted text.
What I have not done:
	I had problems implementing the stargazing sorting list function.
	I did not implement a Light/ Dark mode toggle.
